# DMV_Metro Alexa Skill 

This Alexa Skill used the publicly available [WMATA API](https://developer.wmata.com/docs/services/) to retrieve real-time metro information. Once the skill knows the required intent slots (the departing station and the destination station), it will be able to tell users when the metro will arrive. The skill was built on Alexa Developer Console which involves conversation design, intents handling using Alexa Skill Kit SDK, API integrations.
