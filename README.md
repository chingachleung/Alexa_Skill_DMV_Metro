# DMV_Metro Alexa Skill 
This Alexa skill used the publicly available [WMATA API](https://developer.wmata.com/docs/services/) to retrieve real-time metro information in the DMV area. Once the skill gets the required intent slot values (the departing station and the destination station) from users, it will be able to tell users when the metro will arrive. The skill was built on Alexa developer console which involves conversation design, backend intent handling using Alexa Skill Kit SDK and API integrations.

# Setup Instructions 

You will need to have a Amazon account to log into their developer console.

Once you are on their Alexa Skills developer console, **Create Skill** > **Enter skill name** -> **choose Custom skill** -> **choose either Alexa-hosted (Node.js) or Alexa-hosted(python)**. After that, you can choose an existing template to start with or start from scratch. I decided to start from scratch because there were a template that was doing something similar,and I figured making changes could be more time consuming than starting from scratch.
